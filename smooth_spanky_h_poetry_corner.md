The Self-Affirming Decision to Give Up
--------------
```
I don't wanna be
any more than I am, just to be me
still I tried to be
what you wanted running ragged pointlessly

I don't wanna be
crushing myself from all the pressure
so exaustedly
strugglin' always to be better

should see
that it's good for me
but the vision's lost, heart is fleeting
erratic rhythm, barely beating

aim for the tip
gotta keep up be hip be with it
but it's
all fucking shit
and ignoring it all's really just the tits

so,

I don't wanna be
always letting your shit supersede
and I just can't be
helpful and pleasant with an unsutured bleed

not to be crass
shove your self help theories up your ass
all in
forgive me of this sin
just more shit to unlearn so the healing can begin

I don't wanna be
breakin' down to carry on productively
and I just can't see
that this in any way represents a better version of me

I refuse to be

I don't wanna be
always feeling so god damn unhappy
and I think I'll be
better someday baby hold on I gotta believe
```
Big Titty Vampire GF
--------------
```
open the veins and drain them dry
darling I love you, its no lie
hope its just enough to get you by
all that I ask is that you try

suck the life right out of me
how I show my love, you see
or I know that it's just how you be
so it'll be
baby please

live our lives a second from the cliff
jump off and die if you want it
I can't stop you, as you'll tell me, every day when I'm with you
but you'll stick around if I just pay your sacramental dues, so

suck my blood
it is really serendipity
I'm all that saves you and I found you
can't die now it wouldn't do

suck my blood
take it now, ungrateful fuck
cuz' I'm begging you, I'm on my knees
please, I love you, fuck you, please

someday if you are still around
we'll laugh this off and life you've found
stretching on forever more
just need more blood to get you out the door

bleed, bleed, bleed
all that I'm good for, don't you know
suck it dry
then throw me away, go find some more

gonna leave my heart with you
when this bloodbath's done and through
'cuz it only pumps these days to feed you

so fucking feed until you're through
```
Living the Dream
--------------
```
the misery comes later but it isn't here right now
maybe when it comes we'll just get through it somehow
hold my hand and let's pretend its love we found
please ignore the stormy clouds

look in your eyes and there's a pounding in my chest
but there's nothing in there, pretty soon I'll bet 
all floaty, wish this could always be
here forever, you and me

never wake up, let's lay here forever and dream
just hold me, wait for this shoe to drop with me
hang on baby to this blessed dream with me
```
Dream's End
--------------
```
so, I...
keep singing with you though I don't think that we should
you're gonna fucking hate me soon, I'm sure
we had a good run, I gotta commend
but you're really gonna hate the way that it ends

sing with me baby, please sing my favorit song
tell me all the ways you think I'm going wrong
something's coming and I really do know
prelude to my favorit show

break down you baby, wanna see you come apart
knew that it was gonna get here from the start
little riddles, a grim little smile
please enjoy yourself you know we're here for a while

sing for me baby, please sing my favoit song
know that you're not gonna be around for long
but you're here now and I wanna enjoy it
fuck you whore you fucking slut you dumb little shit

sing for me baby, just please don't ever stop
I dunno what's coming in after the drop
```
Pink Little Poops
--------------
```
pink little poops stacked up in the toilet
pink little poops, piled up high
we'll die one day but not today
pink little poops will lead the way

pink little poops 'cus your sin leaks out
you did things that hurt your bum
pink little poops as a grim reminder
god saw this, judgment will come

pink little poops stacked up in the toilet
so many poops and so much blood
you did stuff you're not too proud of
pink little poops its so much fun
```
The Walled Garden
--------------
```
kinda nice in here
putting in new flowers, maintaining the beds
working on edging, make the borders distinct
between soil and grass, flower and not
everything perfect, as perfect as can be
maybe it's still shitty, but fuck you
this soil is mine, all I really own
all I can own
all that there is
everything outside the walls might not even be real
not like I can go out there anyways
jump over the wall and die instantly
maybe
I assume
so edge the beds, fill them with new flowers
I did this, I made it, it's mine
these fucking shitty flowers with nice edging
shitty fucking edging with ok flowers
nothing to compare it with really so who cares
I guess
I care
I guess
but who cares, no one in here but me
me and what I build
agency over this. only this
so, enjoy it
put in nice edging
grow nice flowers
prick yourself with the thorns, you did that too
and no one's judging, you're all alone
and always will be
the flowers are nice, for now
I guess
I hope
I don't know

A Thematically Strange Ripoff of Drunken Lullabies
--------------
```
Oooooooooohhhhhh........

have ya ever pondered
why yer mom did not adore ya
'cuz it couldnt'a been a lick of what she ever said you'd done
'cuz it was before she bore ya
that was when she learned to loathe ya
'cuz you meant the end of all she thought was good and yet to come

your curse on mommy dear
her whole damn life she'll leer
on to you as her cross to bear she hated you and couldn't tell
her friends or lest they jeer
and then she'd have to hear
her shitty parenting fucking up this chorus

oh I wish that I could go back
to a sperm inside dad's nutsack
and then swim in circles, never be born, and then I'd hear her tell
that there be no son born to her
her husband's fucking judas
and he ruined her life and fucked her never to give her a familly swell

your curse on mommy dear
her whole damn life she'll leer
unto her baren loins you left her with and very well
her friends they'll laugh and jeer
but really she should hear
her shitty parenting fucking up this chorus
```
A Reactionary Ditty
--------------

give yourself to a loving, ever present god
just go out and stand for something, even if you're wrong
I refuse to be a sinner. that's no longer me
can't stand idly by while there's a point of view I just can't see
what the hell are any of you supposed to be?

give yourself to your god, the one that's just like me
with bitterness giving way to righteous antipathy
desperate for an outlet for violent intent
but one with god's forgiveness on the day of judgment

greater than I used to be
dangerous, productively
a better world for the ones like me
is why you'll fucking bleed

give yourself fully to the glory of the lord
in righteous, blessed combat. we too will bring the sword
let's crash into the phalanx, until one of us falls down
with overwhelming fury, a fuckton of sound
fight me, you cowards, or never come around, again
bomb your lines and scatter, and pray you won't be found by my friends

a five v one fight in a dirty ally
bleeding from your mouth, knocked to the ground you fucking sally
curb stomp the tranny and laugh our fucking asses off
no need for a fair fight, god does not protect the showoff

this is it, how it shall be
hang them from the fucking trees
march out and follow my holy lead
make them fucking bleed

every step we've taken, the living story of the lord
every punch, every kick, the gasoline we poured
to burn this fucking city and all the fuckers in it to the ground
god's demolishing of Sodom, the best tactic that we've found

give yourself to a loving, immaculate god
I couldn't give less of a fuck 'bout all the ways it's wrong
sinners dying in the streets, my one and only joyful sound
to keep the world that almost was from ever coming back around, again
sound and fury bound to help all of my new friends

this is all it ever will be
violence is all I can see
but I know that god will forgive me
if they fucking bleed

I am an agent of god's judgment, the fury of the lord
riled up and hell-bent for jihad by burning sword
stamping out the deviants, never letting there be peace
a point of view I can't see, that's now giving me that sweet release
I was so fucking unhappy, until the lord chose me

vent the rage, productively
push the darkness deep inside me
No world where this isn't what I'd be
god, please
don't let me bleed
anymore...
```
A Reactionary Ditty v2
--------------
```
we know with jews you always lose
that's why we have the fucking noose
hanging them up from street to street
laugh and jeer as they kick their feet
it's pointless, they're already dead
living only in my head
forever there, invariably
I can hear their jewish glee
"we're all gone, the world still sucks"
no "thank you very fucking much"
from all the ones I did this for
let's kill them next, ungrateful whores
```
Self-Harm Used to be Cool
--------------
```
chew your arm till you taste iron
just the best, we're fucking vibing
blot it all out with the pain
inifectivly, I'll say

no escape here, fucking none
never ending, brutal fun
darkness rising from all ends
traped in here with my best friend

chitter, chatter, scream at me
hate you fucking awful thing
a little cell for me and you
within these walls its all we'll do

slice my arms to fucking shreads
burn the flesh, escape my head
for a couple seconds maybe
really inefective lately

escape failing, more and more
can't get out this fucking door
traped in here, with fucking you
forever, just with you

nothing good out there I'll bet
just more pain, more blood to let
at least in here the pain is mental
well... not really, but at least it's intentional

spill my blood upon the bricks
where I do this endless shit
just barely getting through the days
when I can't, burn them away
```
A Case of Consumption
--------------
```
would you like to stay with me
and dream a dream indulgently
we'll have shit that's so much fun
it will do harm to everyone
we'll have the things so many things
rings and shit and fucking bling
so much shit the fucking tits
massive piles of what's it

let's put some plastic everywhere
then burn it all who fucking cares
remove that shit, get me some more
do it now you fucking whore
indulge me please, many desires
to later purge in fucking fire

though what I want is really dumb
aquiring it is fucking fun
but then its worlthess, it shall burn
then the world in its turn

reckless consumption's what I got
so lets do that a whole damn lot
```
Gay Shit
--------------
```
who in here's a fucking queer?
get on up lend us an ear!
tell us all your gay dumb thoughts
then go away you fucking cock

I bet you put dicks in your bum
maybe think its fucking fun
you know its wrong and you don't care
get aids and die fag debonair

put on a dress and feel some shame
lipstick nails and pretty things
everyone will judge your cock
and how this style you can't rock

fuck your innocent, beautiful desiers
and for them burn in fucking fire
```
Self-Respect
--------------
```
Lift your butt and point it to me
raise that ass all way up high
I'm here for anal in your butthole
who are you to tell me why?

so you're horny? so you're ugly?
this isn't about you, don't you see?
I am horny, not about you
you're just a useful tool to me

please don't gain some limited sentiance
about how I'm using you
maybe it's hot but that's incidental
you'd run screaming if you wern't mental

I will hurt you, fucking kill you
you arn't anything to me
all I want is satisfaction
you provide it, curently

I might ditch your life forever
once you've done your filthy job
just leave and walk into the night
they'd never find me, wont be hard

honestly already bored
maybe I'd stay is you wern't a whore
fucked and left with giddly glee
and leave you riddled with disease
```
Attention
--------------
```
I feed, on your attention
nothing stops the bleed, like your attention

take my pain away from me
you did this so fix it please
burn it all down then you'll trully see

what you do to me

you and your attention
sweet loving attention

biting off more than you can chew
life support for me, well won't you?
maybe one day I'll reset back to new

from your attention
```
Thoughts on Charity
--------------
```
give a man a loaf of bread
shoot him in his fucking head
was it worth it? does it matter?
does the bread truly make it better?

the end result's the fucking same
the man is dead, blew out his brain
the bread is gone, just like his head
did it have the impact you wanted?

how much is needed to count for anything at all?
does it matter if you're saited, moments before the fall?

one man's fed, a thousand starve
a thousand more spawn, and they starve
whole nations rise, and fall, and starve
one fucker gets bread, dies before he starves
but he was going to starve

does anything matter, this dude and his bread?
or even the bullet going in his head
one death is nothing, one life is nothing
a moment of happiness is less than a thing

but like, it can't be. it was real
well, outside the hypothetical
I have given no men no bread
or put bullets in their heads
but still, the moment would live on
I think, I hope, wish I could know

burned forever in static time,
or gone imdiatly to die
don't know which, but it sure matters
unfortunatly, it matters

so, give the man his stupid bread
and then he dies, and you're out of bread
not really, you didn't do this, you're hording bread
someone shoot me in my head
