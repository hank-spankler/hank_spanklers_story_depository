roll out you super cow
bring this god damn system down
faster stronger every round
max revival when you're down
roll out!
cow!
deth destruction fucking cow
super!
cow!
give em all the runaround

------------------

god damn stupid fucking little fence
tiny blocking ever stoping happiness this fence
come inside and you will see
where we kept our misery
its not here now it is gone
take the fence or be alone
your friend's somewhere not here now
fence is all that's still around
lost support for him it seems
fence is laughing with sick glee

all, in the planning, of the fence

-----------------------

I  love you so, I love you so
I hope you know, I hope you know

-----------------------

but the brain is bad
we're a fucker to eachother
but it won't sit well
go fuck you and fuck your mother

just makes me so sad
its a fucker go and shuck her
hope it does you well
go and fuck her fuck your mother

-----------------

out of the airlock
stepping outside into the light and I'm feelin fine
shoot like an arrow
deep into the night, I'll fly so high just to feel alright 

sing with the stars now
far away with me, i see a dream it will always be
spin out of orbit
escape inside your mind, we'll fly or die or just feel alright

-----------------

little stressy nirvana
like a coal crushed into a diamond
like a crab in the abyss that remains a crab
smooth and functional
I envy that crab, its better at this
although that's not a very crab like thought, is it?

-----------------

two days without pills and I feel like shit
not the worst leash I guess
but I don't feel great about it now
maybe because I'm two days without pills and I feel like shit

------------------

here's a little cellphone, it will ring when people die
or when they want to talk to you
or sell you something, as you do

it will ring all day and night
at night it is an extra fright
past the marketer's long window
each one could make you a widow

someday, at least, not today
it's just a friend who's saying hey
but maybe next time, that's for sure
unless that's just a lie by a marketers

so you'd best pick up the ringing phone
and you'll never be left alone

---------------------

I hate your god damn fucking smile
so incredibly beautiful, havn't seen it in a while

I hate your joy
as much as I wanted to give it to you as your favorit toy

you're gone except the pictures
of a better bit of life

wish you were as happy as you seemed inside the lies
a little horny vision playing out in both our stupid fucking minds

--------------------

meditate on getting hit by another bus
right to the face
maybe regain some of that broken trust
as you flagulate

no escape, really couldn't

-------------------

it's really fitting that we're ringing in the new year with the eternal, sesonal corona
it's a new century, food will never taste as good as it did
the air is styfling from now on
its a new century, everything a little worse than it was the last one
its a new century of diseases
The food will not taste good
