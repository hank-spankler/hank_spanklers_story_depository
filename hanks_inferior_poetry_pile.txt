Here's a place for less good and/or less finished poems.
========================

I, would not say dream
its just not time to greave
it helps to belive
just hurt me and leave
do not know how to be without you in my god damn dreams

I, do not know how
to trust it's how it seems
it cannot be
no light for me
everything will fall apart, the world won't let this be

but it, it can be
so much better for me
don't leave me please
I know how it seems
it could not be another thing but stupid fucking dreams

another pointless conversation about little but about how bad it seems

a little bit of misery that's just for you and me

--------------------

drug my face please
every day drugs every way drugs

please don't escape me
please don't hurt don't leave don't drop me

oh my god the darkness that is slowly leaking into here from all of life's dumb sides
be here please inside my life
do it fuck my veins and fuck my mind
leave it all behind
don't let the haters stop you, fuck them, escape, leave them out to dry

please don't hate me
this is normal goddamn normal
desecrate me
leave me to it
root it toot it

help me leave this stupid life behind
get out of my mind
its all dumb here purge it fucking kill me it is ok time will just rewind

It is so god damn dark in here
I know I can't escape you fucking queer
god damn I hate you why'd you do this what's your purpose why is this all seemingly unclear?

-------------

It's a little bit
over, under it

circle around, the obvious answer

who knows what it is
but, it's obvious

it isn't going, away, it's too damn hip

never, ending today
and, tomorow hurray

never, ending. Never heming

indivisible
and incredible

wish it had my best intrests in its heart

let me know the flow
and just where to go

I wish the exits were clearly marked

it couldn't be coming for us after all this god damn time
shattering images in my mind

couldn't ask for a better intro to the show
lead us all to the god damn disco

please, come dance with me
pin me to the tree

please don't let it be so damn pointless

what's the point of this?
erect through the briss

remove all the things I can't deal with 
 
-------------------------

drinking coffe with the ghost of a bad internet
I'm not really sure about its intent
it can't mean good things for me, but unless it speaks
...
I assume bad internet isn't a thing for me

its pinging my damn servers
really fucking big ones
not letting up on responce
fucking up my diglets
it isn't something to be splayed across its face 
but that god damn internet ghost isn't fighting for the white race

racist internet ghost

to the hoast we toast

to the ashes of the ghost

racist internet ghost

it has some strong opinions, one's that it needs you to know
speaking from a filthy mouth, tinged white as snow

it has thoughts on isrial, most of them really bad
the obvious rhyme here is that it makes me sad

god damn ethnostate loving, racist internet ghost
thoghts on the holocaust, the ones you'd like to hear the most

mostly to laugh at, partially to undertand
the long dead philosiphy, of a very sad man

--------------------------

hello I am a nazi I have many things to say
fuck the jews you know and while we're at it kill the gays
fuck degenerates they all can die inside my fires
build the ovens, die inside and we'll laugh while you expire

oh we're the nazis verilly
and we shall sing out joyfully
that we want racial purity
and so the jews and fags will see
do do do do, do do

that their place is inside a fire
a blessed, joyful, burning pire
where we will burn degeneracy
do do do do, do do

and then happy we will be
do do do do, do do

---------------------------

so

so what differences, shall remain?

when the crust, of another dewy day displayes its face

it, it won't be

another day we all get through, we'll all lay down and face the blade

and it, it won't be

a day for any glory for the chosen race.
get inside please, hide oh god its coming for your face
couldn't be a worse time for this instability all through the race

please, come with me
run away from here, before the time comes

please, it won't be
a good thing when the shit fall through the grates

burn the sewers to the ground
blow the fuck out of this town
please don't leave the darkenss behind
trapped inside the walls of your mind
fucking facist fucking cuck
on my cock you're gonna suck
blow your brains out on the wall
fuck you all I'll kill you all
please give in to my embrace
the bomb goes off soon, get rid of this place.

-------------------

so,
so what differences
so what will we retain when we all rise up
and we face the blade and it gets buisy

and
and what is it
it's all stupid fucking noise and I can't
belive whats in front of my own lips

baby I love you please don't turn down to the light
I bet your vaginal muscless are pretty tight

well what's the difference?
could it be a fucking scam

please be gentle
this isn't my usual
lands.

----------------------

I wish
it wasn't like this, its all fucking shit

I wish
to be like this who's really with it?

I could, coudln't be
smen flowing in the streets

please, don't need
me for anything I do not seem to be

It isn't hard
to understand
it's just a function of a malfunctioning man

--------------------------

It
could not be
but anyways just
kiss me and see
just don't leave me please
a hollow shell of who I think you wanted me to be

-------------------------

bitch phantom bitch phantom bitch phantom fucking fucking fucking bitch

hey bitch, fuck you fuck your fucking tits
hey bitch, why we playing to your hits?

fuck all you stand for and I hate those fucking tits
gonna keep ranting about specifically those tits

hey bitch fuck bitch its a bigger problem then this bitch
fuck tits, superficial nonsense in my mind
couldn't be better cousdn't be worse, coudn't be cursed
if it was true i'd throw up in this hearse
give me your cock in my mouth I don't care I don't care I just want it to hurt

--------------------------------

I'm a good kitty
bad bitty

comupance for the shit I've done
threten suicide for fun
it went pretty fucking well
threats from dead inside the ground
keep me alive, please pretty please?
I need you, want you, fuck you, please?
if not for you I'll fucking die
it'll be your fault if you don't try
who knows if I'll tell you when I go
so much more than you're fucking ho
which I am not, and that I know
but why leave a knife on the table, ya know?
stick it in and twist it in you
fuck me but moreso fuck you too
I'm dying soon, why waste this last chance 
only I can escape this dance

my life is a kidney shot
kamakazi angery thot
die you cunt you think your hot?
suffer for me so maybe I might not

------------------------------

welcome to the tower and now your haunted by the fucking ghost
welcome to the tower, the fun is now living coast to coast
you own property, fuck you fuck you fucking whore
it'll kill itself any day now and then you should have praised the lord

fuck what you want, you're living in here
fuck whatever you want you god damn fucking fucking queer

the long roads stretch on, all you've ever know
keep driving down them, muscle memory get you into the zone

flow from here, while thou will
fuck you queer, it's not about you
it's all over, except in your mind
and you're feeling fine

--------------------------------

What was your standard, what did it mean to you?
Not gonna be weird about it, you filthy fucking jew?
I hate you, don't replace me go away.
I'm walking away and don't know what it means to you.

you know they're not a threat right?
Not really sure you know
bring out your guns please I'd love for you to give me this exact show
wanna watch the world die from the ember's glow
wish we could just get on with this fucking rodeo

grab your guns please, take them out and point them at the sky
can't blame anyone really who is afraid to die
peace be with them all, regardles of what they want
nazi scum choke to death on this cock

-----------------------------------

I
I don't care
it's dosn't matter it never has,
Wish that I hated you but just can't

couldn't be better
never could
but won't get worse I really hope please knock on wood

and I
I hope I'll be
better than the forces I feel acting upon me

I am miserable
but good
I hope that's enough to be in a general sense acceptable to whatever's in vouge.

Capable
so I should

fucking hate you but I can't so here we are and I guess that's good

-------------------------

welsome to the darness
graciously I've let you in
you're something I'm letting haunt me
one of my greatest sins

I hate how I treated you
and how you treated me
fuck you and I guess fuck me too
that's how it ought'a be

I hope you fucking killed yourself
or else you wasted my time
would be nice if that meant anything
sure it didn't though, and that's the thing

I hate your smile
I hate your laugh
anything you used to hurt me in retrospect is bad
fuck this shit
let drugs and booze slowly sap away the memories of all of it

let it all fucking die
like you wanted to but didn't just to burn this into my mind
I hope you fucking die, but you won't I'm sure
and really good on that have a nice life fucking whore.

-------------------------

the ghost of pablo escabar's a fucking cool guy
the us goverment murdered him and wouldn't tell us why
so long as they fucking lie to us, who can really say?
what revenge isn't warented against those fucks, for their grevious ways?
That's why we should blow up the fucking government
make them pay, for all the stuff they've done
might be a big ask but join this political vendetta plz

---------------------

I am magic, fa de lah
I roam the hills, fa lah de dah
who can say what's right and wrong?
live your life fa lah de dah

how is it your stocks are doing?
through the prolatarient they're chewing
grinding up their labor between desires
of never again this system doing

it never really ends
just rope in aditional freinds
but it's never for their sake
grind them benethe your boots, their labor's yours to take

build the factory up high
poke god in his fucking eye
don't let the sin impede you just push forth to where you speed to
we will bring on forth the end
you're coming with me, all my friends
I wish no harm upon ye but this is part of the trend

---------------------------------

fuck you whore, you fucking suck
get hit by a fucking truck
and if you live a curse upon your familly you god dam fucking fuck
a cock placed firmly in your eye
and from it get a fucking stye
I hate everything about you, why don't you love me fucking cunt?

it shoulda coulda woulda been love
woulda if you wernt a damn cunt

---------------------------------

I
am
drunk

think of me as a fucking hunk
just tell your momma "shunk"

tell her that, just that nothing but that only that and I hope she tries to clap on back

it'd be silly

what would you even say to shunk?

It's not a word with meaning

fight it and you'll just reveal your feelings

------------------------

whoever could tell
I don't fucking know
who told you anyways please don't yell
just don't fucking show
the whole thing to the others
whatever it meaans I don't know
and I don't wanna know

please don't unleash the beast
keep it hidden deep inside of me
so it seems
it cannot be
and so I'll feast
it couldn't be another way while being draged by my leash

------------------

yo ho ho
it's another old thing
a bucket of swing

ye hee hee
get the fucking thing
away from me

never been better and fuck you you'll see

--------------------------------

look over the life you had and question if it matters
we die or go to hell, I hope it's not the latter
suffer in the lake or we will suffer our own fates
while the vampires at the top get fatter fucking fatter

please don't question why you're here
work all day, go home, drink beer
it is great, this fucking fate
be glad at least you're not a queer

you think your life sucks, oh well don't you?
fuck you, fickle fucking damn shrew
starving kiddies get the pitty
don't be a greedy fucking jew

------------------------------

I don't wanna be
letting you down so constantly
and I tried to be
what you wanted running ragged pointlessly

I don't wanna be
any more than I am just to be me
and I just can't be
constantly compared to a non-existiant perfect me

I see
a world where I want to be
but the vision's unclear, heart is fleeting
eratic rythem, barely beating

because,
it all piles up so hard
lays in past my shitty gaurd
paralysis from all the pressure
only good if I am better

get in the slip
gotta keep up be hip be with it
and it's
all fucking shit
and ignoring it all really is the tits

I don't wanna be
constantly struggling just to be me
and I just can't seem
happy and plesent with an unsutured bleed

not to be crass
shove your self help thory up your ass

all in
forgive me of this social sin
but it's just another thing to unlearn before healing can begin

and you know why?

I don't wanna be
breaking down to carry on productivly
I refuse to see
that this in any way represents a better version of me

flex that agency!

I don't wanna be
always feeling so god damn unhappy
and I think I'll be
better some day baby hold on you gotta belive

---------------------------------

death comes in the form of a giant, very scary horse
super spooky cloping as it does its evil course
clopping into nightmares of violent police assault
very scary horse I hate it go away I really need it not
big old scary demon horse
wildly excesive force
coming down with zero remorse
here comes the line of horse

------------------------------

conserve your dollars and wait for the day
when will it be, who really can say?
do it so it can be what you eat
someday maybe soon i hope be leet

dropping flopping fucking plopping
its all dumb and nonsense drop it
hope you all god damn do die
take my funds dont ever again try

--------------------------

poop de poop de poop de poop
I will not be eating poop
cannot be the one who eats
poop de poop de poop de poop

--------------------------

I, wish,
wish I could just be
somewhere stable somewhere condusive to just a simple being
so
so fucking close to me
pain and misery and rot and coruption all around me

fuck you all
fucking hate your gall
why do you think you even need to be involved?
I think I know

fuck you all
fucking god dam fools

simple to see
easy for you and me
unthinkable but necesary, very sadly

couldn't be worse
easy summoned herse
things are wrong
it's clear to all but taboo fucking suck my raw dong

---------------

got a pocket full of names, a pocket full of sunshine
trotting down the vally and I'm feeling so damn fine
plink em in the back and trot on the cadavers
clip and clop along and feel the fucking splatter

horse stuff!
scary horse stuff
horse stuff,
can't get enough

trot along you horsies down a vally that is not mine
will be soon enough though and the feeling is just divine

-----------------

you have no agency
nothing you do matters
everything sucks

well, thar isn't true
you have agency, technically
is it agency if you can pick totally irrelevent actions?
I don't know.

----------------

powerless, I guess
stuff happens to me and I bend
which sucks, all stuff is bad

no one broke my face at least
others put before the beast
not a lot of reason to be sad

powerless, unhhappilly
something no one cares to see
lick those boots, be a good lad

what the fuck's the point of being mad?

---------------------------------

what the hell am I even drugging away
if I'm trying to wallow in it all the same?
I guess misery just feels better with a little fuz
please get me really fucking buzzed
then just black out, a few moments carry me away
get me out of here

-----------------------

christmas was good, we are all well
thank fucking god

-----------------------

burn it down, motherfucer
why do you even need to try?
they all hate you so just do it
don't get sucked into their lies

burn it down, motherfucker
do it and commit your sin
there's no reason not to do it
trace the vein and plunge it in

-------------------------

but I hope, it is for me
hange me up by
the highest tree
and I hope it will be
so
so fucking good
make me finaly feel the way I should
I should be
so fucking happy

it is good, did it for me
it's all I want as I'm sure you will see
good
good and its for me
lift my head, speread my seed
do all the things I want and its all for me
just please, babey come with me
do it please maybe

---------------------------

because all that I want is my labor
all that I want is a home
know we won't get it but I dare to dream
that one day my life I will own

------------------

god damn stupid fucking little fence
tiny blocking ever stoping happiness this fence
come inside and you will see
where we kept our misery
its not here now it is gone
take the fence or be alone
your friend's somewhere not here now
fence is all that's still around
lost support for him it seems
fence is laughing with sick glee

all, in the planning, of the fence

-----------------------

I  love you so, I love you so
I hope you know, I hope you know

-----------------------

but the brain is bad
we're a fucker to eachother
but it won't sit well
go fuck you and fuck your mother

just makes me so sad
its a fucker go and shuck her
hope it does you well
go and fuck her fuck your mother

-----------------

out of the airlock
stepping outside into the light and I'm feelin fine
shoot like an arrow
deep into the night, I'll fly so high just to feel alright 

sing with the stars now
far away with me, i see a dream it will always be
spin out of orbit
escape inside your mind, we'll fly or die or just feel alright

-----------------

little stressy nirvana
like a coal crushed into a diamond
like a crab in the abyss that remains a crab
smooth and functional
I envy that crab, its better at this
although that's not a very crab like thought, is it?

-----------------

two days without pills and I feel like shit
not the worst leash I guess
but I don't feel great about it now
maybe because I'm two days without pills and I feel like shit

------------------

here's a little cellphone, it will ring when people die
or when they want to talk to you
or sell you something, as you do

it will ring all day and night
at night it is an extra fright
past the marketer's long window
each one could make you a widow

someday, at least, not today
it's just a friend who's saying hey
but maybe next time, that's for sure
unless that's just a lie by a marketers

so you'd best pick up the ringing phone
and you'll never be left alone

---------------------

I hate your god damn fucking smile
so incredibly beautiful, havn't seen it in a while

I hate your joy
as much as I wanted to give it to you as your favorit toy

you're gone except the pictures
of a better bit of life

wish you were as happy as you seemed inside the lies
a little horny vision playing out in both our stupid fucking minds

--------------------

meditate on getting hit by another bus
right to the face
maybe regain some of that broken trust
as you flagulate

no escape, really couldn't

-------------------

it's really fitting that we're ringing in the new year with the eternal, sesonal corona
it's a new century, food will never taste as good as it did
the air is styfling from now on
its a new century, everything a little worse than it was the last one
its a new century of diseases
The food will not taste good

----------------------

light a match and burn it down
it was never meant to be

march on forward to the sound
turned to ashes with sick glee

this wold will come
undone

please be kind to everyone my son
get them all under your rightous thumb

flames licking at the cross
what was sacred to us forgoten, entierly lost

what will sustain us?
when we have nothing left to overcome
and what will save us?
death comes for all of us, one by fucking one by fucking one

live for the moment
it will be your last it never ends
let it consume you
go insain and die my favorit friend

light a match, put it on your skin
time slows to standstill
this is your moment, please go on, force your way in
go commit your sin

------------------------------

welcome to the ride!
it never ends, it never ends
fuck what you want forever
fuck you friend, fuck you friend

it could be worse, could be a lot better
negative feelings at all times, forever!

welcome to the ride!
its on its way down, all the way down
into a deep mire where you know that you'll drown
right on its way to where you know you can't go
deep into the depths of a psyche that you don't want to know

welcome to the ride!
it's for my friends, and you're my freind
and we are rather chumy, arn't we?
stuck with me, 'till the end

welcome to the ride, you can never leave

------------------------------

hurt me
hurt me baby

if you love me, make me bleed
if you need it, take it please
I deserve it, I belive
its blood in my veins that you need
you're gonna drain them, and you'll feed
feed on me, baby, please

just please
please be well
while I die here its not pointless
if it lifts you from your mental hell

take my blood, take my soul
leave me a shell, to make you whole

and kill me
kill me baby
please live
kill me baby

I don't need to go on, you do
sorry this is what the voodoo
demands of me and mostly you

I hope you're ok
I know that you're not
I feel like a god damn fucking cock
kill me baby
just let it do good for you
kill me baby
please

-------------------

all I want right now's to die
if not for you then I would try
but your efforts just don't work
why stay alive you fucking jerk?

what do you want?
is it for me?
hang me from a fucking tree
Try to keep the thoughts inside
but for you why should I hide?

the subway tunnel has the answer
jump in it and fucking splatter
I will do this just for spite
fuck you boy I'll die tonight

what do you want?
is it for me?
hange me from a fucking tree
just don't leave me or I will
suicide's a fucking thrill

all I want right now's to die
you won't stop me, please don't try
you could help, that'd be nice
will you guide me to paradice?

what do you want?
is it for me?
hang me from a fucking tree
please give me this one desires
burn me up in fucking fire

all I want right now's to die
you wont help me, just won't try
force me to live another day
suffering you won't alley

what do you want?
is it for me?
hang me from a fucking tree
helping me's within your power
but you won't, you fucking coward

-----------------------------

miserable consistant rythem
need miserable consistant rythem
need fucking harsh consistant rythem

it couldn't be, how it ought to be
meaningful, poingent, transcendentally

but it lives in my mind
something I just can't find
mierable consistant rythem

and it just can't fucking be
something not a part of me
too deep seated to be ignorably
something about it fills the need

it shouldn't be, but here it be
simple, easy and unecesary
it lives in my mind
so bad and yet so sublime
something I can't see that's right in front of my eyes

miserable consistant rythem
animate what is within 'em

--------------------

well its ok I guess, whatever
won't see you again, no never
it's all over if you leave tonight

it's a really easy answer
jump onto the tracks and splatter
hope that you can carry on alright

give me blood I need it, feed me
just don't ever fucking leave me
not safe without you at my loving side
which is why I'm gonna die tonight
